- When pivoting marketing strategy for an existing product

## Context Files (Read First)
1. Project's `CLAUDE.md` - Understand the product
2. Project's `progress.txt` - See what's been tried
3. Any existing `LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md` or marketing docs

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Discovery Questions

Before creating the plan, ask these questions (adapt to what's already known):

```markdown
**Product Understanding:**
A) What problem does this solve? Who feels that pain most acutely?
B) What's your pricing model? (Free, freemium, one-time, subscription)
C) What's your launch timeline? (Ready now, 1 week, 1 month)

**Resources & Constraints:**
D) Marketing budget? ($0 organic only, <$100/mo, <$500/mo, $500+/mo)
E) Time available for marketing? (1 hr/week, 5 hrs/week, dedicated)
F) What assets exist? (Video, landing page, email list, social accounts)

**Competitive Landscape:**
G) Who are the top 2-3 competitors? (Or should I research?)
H) What makes you different/better?

**Goals:**
I) Primary metric? (Signups, revenue, users, downloads)
J) Target for first 30 days? 90 days?
```

Wait for answers before proceeding.
