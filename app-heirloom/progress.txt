# Heirloom Progress Log

## Session - 2025-01-22

**Completed:**
- Reviewed full task list and project status
- Created Zoom/Teams background image prompt aligned with brand identity

**Zoom Background Prompt (Final):**
```
Minimal elegant video call background. Soft ivory linen fabric texture filling
the frame. Gentle golden-hour light washing across from the upper left, creating
subtle warmth and soft shadows in the fabric folds. In the lower right corner,
a small curated arrangement rests on the linen: a vintage photograph with softly
curled edges, an antique brass pocket watch, and a classic film camera - all
beautifully blurred and soft focus. Muted palette: ivory cream (#F8F5EE), whisper
of heritage green in the shadows, warm gold in the light. Calm, quiet, refined.
The stillness of a Sunday morning. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

**Current Project Status:**

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Brand Identity | Complete |
| MVP Feature Spec | Complete |
| Tech Stack | Decided (Next.js + React Native + Supabase) |
| Database Schema | Deployed to Supabase |
| Mobile App UI | Polished mockup complete |
| Web Landing Page | Scaffolded, needs polish |
| Authentication | Not implemented |
| Real Data Integration | Not implemented |
| Recording Functionality | Not implemented |

**Next Steps (Priority Order):**
1. [ ] Implement Supabase authentication flow
2. [ ] Connect mobile app to real database (replace mock data)
3. [ ] Build recording functionality with expo-av
4. [ ] Add file upload to Supabase Storage
5. [ ] Polish and deploy landing page
6. [ ] Family invite flow

**Decisions Made:**
- Zoom background should be minimal: linen texture, soft golden light, subtle trinkets (photo, pocket watch, camera)
- Brand visual style: documentary warmth, not corporate/stock

**Gotchas:**
- Mobile app path is `apps/mobile` (React Native/Expo)
- Web app path is `apps/web` (Next.js)
- Supabase migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
