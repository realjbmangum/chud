- **Plan type:** Individual only at launch, no Family Plan yet
- **Business model priority:** Consumer first, enterprise second

### MVP Status

## Strategic Direction

### Two Business Models (Prioritized)
1. **Consumer platform** (FIRST) — user-friendly legacy preservation for families
2. **Enterprise / HaaS** (SECOND) — white-label for institutions once consumer product is proven

### Enterprise Verticals Identified
- **Financial advisors / wealth planners** — Edward Jones, UBS, capital consultants
  - Oliver spoke with a capital firm in Atlanta — interested in all three offerings (HX documentary, Heirloom consumer, Heirloom enterprise)
  - Their angle: helping wealthy clients with unhealthy money relationships spend on meaningful things
  - "Spend your money on this because it's for your people"
- **Funeral homes** — Brian's first thought
- **Churches** — community legacy preservation (Oliver's story: Baptist church 100-year yearbook)
- **Estate planners**
- **CaringBridge-style health use case** — Brian knows someone using CaringBridge for terminal illness updates; potential adjacent feature

### Flywheel / Growth Engine
- **Community is the flywheel** — not features
- Brian's ancestry.com story: shared a photo of his grandpa with his aunt who had never seen it
- Oliver's church yearbook story: community involvement drove engagement
- Vision: "Build the house for them to play around in, but they're making it what it is"
- Public sharing, tagging people, family tree discovery — these drive organic growth
- Less about adding features, more about community driving communication inside the platform

### Competitive Positioning
- Most competitors focused on "digital sell of a physical product" (books, prints)
- Heirloom is a digital platform that preserves legacy — book is an optional add-on, not the core
- Oliver's framing: "Facebook for families that never dies"
- Total addressable market: "How many people live on planet earth?"
- Both feel what they're building is genuinely different from anything out there

### Oliver's 2-Minute Pitch (Verbatim)
> "Heirloom is a digital platform designed to help individuals and families capture and preserve their stories, values, and wisdom through guided prompts, videos, photographs, and reflections so that they can pass down more than just assets to future generations. Who we serve is parents, grandparents, families, individuals, and institutions that care deeply about legacy, memory, and meaning. The problem that we solve is that most people don't intentionally preserve their story until it's too late. When someone passes, we're left with fragments. Photos without context, memories without voices, and stories that slowly disappear with time. That loss matters because identity, wisdom, and values are transferred through story, not through spreadsheets."

## Business / Legal

### Entity Formation
- No entity formed yet
- Plan: File **S-corp in an opportunity zone** (no capital gains on exit)
- Launchpad program may help facilitate this
- Need to decide: company name, trademark, bank account
- Brian: "I'd rather wait to absorb any breaks we can get" before forming entity
- **50/50 ownership confirmed**

### Roles
- **Brian:** Tech co-founder, builder, behind the keyboard
- **Oliver:** Face of Heirloom, networker, business development
- Oliver: "I should be with this, whatever this is" (re: his charisma)
- Brian: "I consider you completely the face of heirloom"

### Exit Strategy
- Both aligned: **build to sell**, not build to operate forever
- Brian: "The fun part is the building of it and then the selling of it"
- Oliver: "I like building. I don't like [operating long-term]"
- No specific exit number discussed — agreed to ponder it

### Launchpad Program
- Oliver handles Wednesday calls, pulls Brian in as needed
- Curriculum not super useful (already at "step 60 of 100")
- Main value: **networking** and entity formation guidance
- Brian will come to Greenville for key in-person meetings (investors, advisors, etc.)
- Both agree: focus on what's useful, leave the rest behind

### Finances
- Brian currently paying ~$20/mo for database/software
- No payments collected until entity + Stripe are properly set up
- Oliver's Plantin app reference: lifetime $40 purchase model — but acknowledged Heirloom's data storage costs make that model different

---

## Emotional Core
- Brian: started this after his mom died suddenly — "it just happened"
- Oliver: "Most people don't intentionally preserve their story until it's too late"
- Brian's Christmas vision: phone pops up "Want to watch this video of your Christmas in 1987 with your dad?"
- CaringBridge use case: 40-year-old woman with terminal cancer now recording everything
