TWEET 1 (post first, then reply chain):
I built a free tool to help South Carolinians get DMV appointments faster.

scdmvappointments.com monitors all 65 SC DMV locations 24/7 and sends you an alert the instant a road test slot opens up.

Stop refreshing. Start driving.

TWEET 2:
The problem:

SC DMV road test appointments book out 3-4 weeks.

Your only option? Refresh the website constantly hoping someone cancels.

Waste of time. Frustrating. Easy to miss openings.

TWEET 3:
The solution:

I built a system that checks for new appointments every 5 minutes - even at 3am when cancellations often drop.

When a slot opens, you get an instant email (or text with Pro).

TWEET 4:
What it covers:

- Road tests (Class D)
- Motorcycle tests
- CDL (Class A, B, C)

All 65 SC DMV locations across 8 regions:
Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Spartanburg, Florence, Rock Hill, Aiken

TWEET 5:
The free tier gets you 1 alert per day.

Pro ($5.99/mo) = 3 alerts + SMS
CDL Pro ($19.99/mo) = 5 alerts + SMS + CDL types

Most people just need the free version.

I am not affiliated with the DMV - just a developer who got tired of the refresh game.

TITLE:
I built a free tool to help South Carolinians get DMV road test appointments faster

BODY:
Hey r/southcarolina,

Like a lot of you, I got frustrated trying to book a DMV appointment. The official site shows everything booked out for weeks, and the only option is to keep refreshing and hope for a cancellation.

So I built scdmvappointments.com - it monitors all 65 SC DMV locations every few minutes and sends you a free email alert the moment an appointment opens up.

What it covers:
- Road tests (Class D)
- Motorcycle tests
- CDL (Class A, B, C)
- All 8 regions: Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Spartanburg, Florence, Rock Hill, Aiken

How it works:
1. Sign up with your email
2. Pick your region and test type
3. Get an alert when a slot opens
4. Book it on the official DMV site before anyone else

The free tier gets you 1 alert per day - that is enough for most people. There is a paid option for more alerts plus SMS if you are in a hurry.

I am not affiliated with the DMV at all - just a developer who got tired of the refresh game.

Would love feedback if you try it. And if you have tips for getting appointments faster, drop them below.

Local Developer Creates Free Tool to Help SC Residents Get DMV Appointments Faster

BODY:
Hi,

South Carolina DMV appointments often book out 3-4 weeks, leaving residents stuck refreshing the website hoping for cancellations.

I built scdmvappointments.com - a free service that monitors all 65 SC DMV locations 24/7 and sends instant alerts when appointments open up.

A similar service in North Carolina was recently featured on WCNC and has helped over 2,000 residents book appointments faster. I wanted to offer the same solution for South Carolina.

Would you be interested in a quick story? I am happy to provide:
- Screenshots and a demo of how it works
- Data on appointment availability across SC
- A brief interview about why I built it

The service is free and I am not affiliated with the DMV - just a developer who got frustrated with the system.

Thank you for your time.

Totally understand the skepticism. It is a side project I built - not affiliated with the DMV at all. The free tier is actually free with no credit card required.

BUG REPORT:
Oh no, sorry about that. Can you DM me the details? I will fix it ASAP. Thanks for letting me know.

MOD QUESTION:
Happy to take this down if it is against the rules - just wanted to share something I thought might help folks here. Let me know.
