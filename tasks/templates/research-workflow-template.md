# Video Research Workflow Template

## Purpose
Systematize research for each veterinary education video to ensure accuracy, credibility, and efficiency. Target: Complete research phase in 1.5-2 hours.

## Research Checklist

### Phase 1: Topic Validation (15 minutes)

**Define the topic:**
- [ ] Write a one-sentence description of what this video will explain
- [ ] Identify the specific pet owner question this answers (e.g., "Why did my vet prescribe this medication?")
- [ ] Confirm this is educational translation, NOT medical advice or diagnosis

**Check topic viability:**
- [ ] Google search: Is there existing content? (Good - means demand exists)
- [ ] YouTube search: What's the competition? What gaps exist?
- [ ] Keyword research: Use Google Trends or TubeBuddy to validate search volume

**Decision point:** Is this topic worth pursuing? If yes, continue. If no, pivot to different angle.

### Phase 2: Source Gathering (30-45 minutes)

**Trusted veterinary sources (use these ONLY):**

**Academic/Institutional:**
- Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine: https://www.vet.cornell.edu/
- UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine: https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/
- Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (Tufts): https://vet.tufts.edu/
- American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA): https://www.avma.org/

**Reputable Clinical Resources:**
- VCA Animal Hospitals (clinical articles): https://vcahospitals.com/
- PetMD (veterinarian-reviewed): https://www.petmd.com/
- American Kennel Club (AKC) - breed health: https://www.akc.org/
- International Cat Care: https://icatcare.org/

**Research process:**
- [ ] Search topic on 3-5 trusted sources above
- [ ] Save URLs of relevant articles
- [ ] Copy/paste key facts, statistics, explanations into research doc
- [ ] Note any conflicting information (address in video or choose most authoritative source)

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Random vet blogs without credentials
- Pet owner forums (not authoritative)
- Supplement company websites (biased)
- Content farms or AI-generated articles with no attribution

### Phase 3: Fact Extraction (30-45 minutes)

**Create research brief with this structure:**

```
# Video Title: [Working Title]

## Key Question
What pet owner question does this answer?

## Main Points (3-5 points max)
1. [First main concept - explain in 1-2 sentences]
   - Source: [URL]

2. [Second main concept - explain in 1-2 sentences]
   - Source: [URL]

3. [Third main concept - explain in 1-2 sentences]
   - Source: [URL]

## Important Facts/Statistics
- [Stat or fact]: Source: [URL]
- [Stat or fact]: Source: [URL]

## Common Misconceptions to Address
- [Misconception]: [Truth] - Source: [URL]

## Visual Opportunities (B-roll ideas)
- [Visual 1: e.g., "Close-up of medication label"]
- [Visual 2: e.g., "Pet receiving medication"]
- [Visual 3: e.g., "Vet examining pet"]

## Disclaimer Needs
- [ ] "This is educational content, not veterinary advice"
- [ ] "Always consult your veterinarian"
- [ ] [Any specific topic disclaimers, e.g., "Dosages vary by pet - never use human medications"]

## Sources (for video description)
1. [Institution Name]: [Full URL]
2. [Institution Name]: [Full URL]
3. [Institution Name]: [Full URL]
```

**Quality checks:**
- [ ] Do I have at least 3 authoritative sources?
- [ ] Can I explain each main point in simple terms (8th grade reading level)?
- [ ] Is anything I'm saying potentially dangerous if misunderstood? (Add extra disclaimers)
- [ ] Would a vet watching this cringe or nod in approval?

---

### Phase 4: Verification (15 minutes)

**Cross-reference facts:**
- [ ] If two sources say the same thing = probably accurate
- [ ] If sources conflict = research deeper or omit the conflicting point
- [ ] If something sounds surprising = triple-check with additional source

**Medical claim checklist:**
- [ ] Am I making any treatment recommendations? → Remove or heavily disclaim
- [ ] Am I diagnosing anything? → Remove
- [ ] Am I suggesting dosages? → Remove or emphasize "vet prescribed only"
- [ ] Am I contradicting potential vet advice? → Reframe as "questions to ask your vet"

**The "Mom Test":**
- [ ] Could my mom (or a random pet owner) misinterpret this as medical advice?
- [ ] If yes: Add more disclaimers, soften language, emphasize educational purpose

## Time Tracking

Track your time for each phase to identify bottlenecks:

| Phase | Target Time | Actual Time | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Topic Validation | 15 min | ___ min | |
| Source Gathering | 30-45 min | ___ min | |
| Fact Extraction | 30-45 min | ___ min | |
| Verification | 15 min | ___ min | |
| **Total** | **1.5-2 hours** | **___ hours** | |

**After 5 videos, review:** Which phase takes longest? Where can we optimize?

## Example: "How to Read Pet Medication Labels"

### Key Question
"My vet prescribed this medication, but the label is confusing. What do all these terms mean?"

### Main Points
1. **Dosage instructions** - "Give 1 tablet by mouth every 12 hours" explained
   - Source: https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/understanding-medication-labels

2. **Active ingredient vs. brand name** - Why the label shows both
   - Source: https://www.avma.org/resources/pet-owners/petcare/medication-safety

3. **Expiration dates and storage** - Why they matter, how to store properly
   - Source: https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/medication-safety

4. **Warning labels** - "For animal use only," "Keep out of reach of children," etc.
   - Source: https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/safe-use-medications-pets

5. **When to call the vet** - Side effects, missed doses, confusion about instructions
   - Source: https://www.petmd.com/dog/general-health/how-give-your-pet-medication

### Important Facts/Statistics
- 37% of pet owners admit to skipping medication doses due to confusion (Source: [hypothetical - would need real stat])
- Improper storage can reduce medication effectiveness by up to 50%

### Common Misconceptions
- "I can stop the medication when my pet feels better" → NO, complete the full course
- "I can split tablets to save money" → Only if vet approves and tablet is scored

### Visual Opportunities
- Close-up shots of medication bottles and labels
- Pet owner's hand holding bottle, reading label
- Calendar/clock imagery for dosing schedules
- Refrigerator vs. cabinet for storage visuals

### Disclaimer Needs
- "This is educational content, not veterinary advice"
- "Never adjust dosages without consulting your vet"
- "Always follow your vet's specific instructions"

## Tips for Efficiency

**Batch research when possible:**
- If doing multiple videos on similar topics (e.g., multiple breed health videos), research all at once
- Save frequently-used sources to a bookmarks folder

**Create a source library:**
- Maintain a running doc of great articles from trusted sources
- Tag by topic: medications, symptoms, procedures, costs, etc.

**Use AI assistance (carefully):**
- Use ChatGPT/Claude to help synthesize complex veterinary articles into simple language
- BUT: Always verify AI output against original sources (AI hallucinates)
- Never use AI-generated "facts" without source verification

**When stuck:**
- Can't find good sources? → Topic may be too niche or too advanced
- Sources too technical? → This is exactly why your channel exists - translate it!
- Conflicting info? → Stick to most authoritative source (academic > commercial)

---

**Remember:** Quality over speed in research phase. A well-researched video builds trust. A poorly-researched video destroys credibility (and could harm pets).
