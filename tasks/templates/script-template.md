# Video Script Template

## Purpose
Reusable script structure for 5-7 minute veterinary education videos. Optimized for AI voiceover, viewer retention, and clear educational value.

**Target length:** 1,200-1,500 words = 5-7 minutes at 175-200 words per minute

---

## Script Structure

### 1. HOOK (First 10 seconds - CRITICAL)

**Goal:** Stop the scroll. Make viewer want to keep watching.

**Formula:** Problem + Promise

```
[VISUAL: B-roll of [relevant scene]]

"[Relatable problem statement that pet owner has experienced].

[Promise of what they'll learn in this video].

[Optional: Quick credibility statement]. Let's break it down."
```

**Example - Medication Labels:**
```
[VISUAL: Close-up of confused pet owner holding prescription bottle]

"Your vet just prescribed medication for your dog, but the label looks like it's written in another language.

In the next 6 minutes, I'll translate every part of that label so you know exactly what you're giving your pet, when to give it, and what to watch for.

All information is sourced from veterinary schools and the AVMA. Let's break it down."
```

**Hook Writing Tips:**
- Use "you" and "your pet" immediately (personal)
- State the problem they're Googling (e.g., "confused by medication label")
- Promise a specific outcome (not vague like "learn about medications")
- Keep it under 40 words
- Avoid: "Welcome to the channel" or "Hit subscribe" - too early!

---

### 2. INTRO / CONTEXT (30-45 seconds)

**Goal:** Set up why this topic matters and what we'll cover.

**Formula:** Why This Matters + What We'll Cover + Disclaimer

```
[VISUAL: Continue relevant B-roll or switch to AI presenter]

"[Why this topic is important - cite a stat or common scenario if possible].

Here's what we'll cover today:
- [Main point 1]
- [Main point 2]
- [Main point 3]
- And [final point or CTA]

Before we start: This is educational content to help you understand your vet's advice. It's not a substitute for veterinary care. Always follow your vet's specific instructions for your pet."
```

**Example - Medication Labels:**
```
[VISUAL: Switch to AI presenter OR continue B-roll]

"Medication errors are one of the most common reasons pet owners call their vet after a visit. Sometimes it's confusing dosing schedules, sometimes it's not understanding storage requirements.

Here's what we'll cover today:
- How to read dosage instructions correctly
- The difference between brand names and active ingredients
- Why expiration dates and storage matter more than you think
- And when you should call your vet with questions

Before we start: This is educational content to help you understand your vet's advice. It's not a substitute for veterinary care. Always follow your vet's specific instructions for your pet."
```

**Intro Writing Tips:**
- Roadmap creates viewer commitment ("I want to know all 4 things")
- Disclaimer is required - make it natural, not robotic
- Keep intro under 100 words total

---

### 3. MAIN CONTENT (3-4 minutes - Body of the video)

**Goal:** Deliver on the promise. Educate clearly and completely.

**Formula:** 3-5 main points, each with structure: Explain → Example → Visual cue

#### Point 1: [Topic]

```
[VISUAL: B-roll related to this point OR on-screen text highlighting key term]

**[Subheading - the thing you're explaining]**

"[Explanation in simple language - 2-3 sentences max].

Here's what this looks like in practice: [Concrete example].

[Optional: Common mistake or misconception to address]."

[B-ROLL CUE: Suggest specific visual here]
```

**Example - Point 1: Dosage Instructions:**
```
[VISUAL: Close-up of medication label, highlighting dosage section]

**Understanding Dosage Instructions**

"The dosage line tells you how much to give and how often. You'll typically see something like 'Give 1 tablet by mouth every 12 hours.'

Here's what this means: One tablet, not crushed or split unless your vet says so, goes in your pet's mouth - not in food unless specified - and you'll give it twice a day, 12 hours apart. So if you give it at 8am, the next dose is 8pm.

A common mistake: Pet owners think 'every 12 hours' means 'morning and night,' but if morning is 7am and night is 11pm, that's 16 hours apart - not 12. Use a phone alarm to keep it consistent."

[B-ROLL CUE: Calendar/clock visual showing 12-hour spacing, or pet owner setting phone alarm]
```

#### Point 2: [Topic]

```
[Follow same structure as Point 1]
```

#### Point 3: [Topic]

```
[Follow same structure as Point 1]
```

**Repeat for 3-5 main points depending on topic complexity**

**Main Content Writing Tips:**
- Each point = 200-300 words
- Use short sentences (max 20 words when possible)
- Avoid medical jargon - if you must use it, define it immediately
- Include at least one concrete example per point
- Add B-roll cues inline so editor knows what visuals to use
- Break up AI presenter talking with B-roll every 20-30 seconds

---

### 4. COMMON MISTAKES / MISCONCEPTIONS (30-45 seconds)

**Goal:** Address what pet owners get wrong. Shows you understand their experience.

**Formula:** "Before we wrap up, let's clear up some common confusion..."

```
[VISUAL: AI presenter OR relevant B-roll]

"Before we wrap up, let's clear up a couple things pet owners often get wrong:

**Misconception 1:** [State the wrong belief]
**Reality:** [Correct it]

**Misconception 2:** [State the wrong belief]
**Reality:** [Correct it]

[Optional: "If you've made these mistakes, don't worry - you're not alone. Just adjust moving forward."]"
```

**Example - Medication Labels:**
```
[VISUAL: AI presenter]

"Before we wrap up, let's clear up a couple things pet owners often get wrong:

**Misconception 1:** "I can stop giving the medication once my pet seems better."
**Reality:** Unless your vet specifically says otherwise, complete the full course. Stopping early can lead to relapse or antibiotic resistance.

**Misconception 2:** "All tablets can be crushed and mixed with food."
**Reality:** Some medications have special coatings that break down in specific parts of the digestive system. Crushing them can make them ineffective or cause stomach upset. Only crush if your vet approves."
```

---

### 5. CALL TO ACTION / RECAP (20-30 seconds)

**Goal:** Reinforce key takeaways and encourage engagement.

**Formula:** Recap + Empowerment + CTA

```
[VISUAL: AI presenter]

"So to recap:
- [Key takeaway 1 in 5-8 words]
- [Key takeaway 2 in 5-8 words]
- [Key takeaway 3 in 5-8 words]

[Empowerment statement: "You now know..." or "Next time..."]

If this helped you understand [topic], give it a thumbs up so other pet owners can find it. And drop a comment if you have questions - I read every one.

[Optional: Next video tease if you have related content]

Thanks for watching, and as always, when in doubt, call your vet."
```

**Example - Medication Labels:**
```
[VISUAL: AI presenter]

"So to recap:
- Dosage timing matters - use alarms for consistency
- Check storage requirements - some meds need refrigeration
- Complete the full course even if your pet seems better

You now know how to read every part of that medication label, and more importantly, you know what questions to ask if anything's unclear.

If this video helped, give it a thumbs up so other confused pet owners can find it. And drop a comment with your biggest medication question - I read every one and they help me know what videos to make next.

Thanks for watching, and as always, when in doubt, call your vet."
```

**CTA Writing Tips:**
- Recap should be SHORT bullet points, not full explanations
- Ask for like/comment AFTER delivering value, not before
- Make comment ask specific (not just "let me know what you think")
- Always end with a trust-building reminder (consult vet)

## Script Formatting for Production

### Voiceover Notes
- Mark any words that might be mispronounced: [pronunciation: "dysplasia" = dis-PLAY-zhuh]
- Mark pauses: [PAUSE] for natural breath points
- Mark emphasis: *Italics* for words to stress

### Visual Cues
- [VISUAL: Description] at start of each section
- [B-ROLL CUE: Specific shot needed] inline in script
- [ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Key term or stat"] for graphics to add in editing

### Example Formatted Section:
```
[VISUAL: Close-up of dog receiving pill]

"Here's a pro tip for actually getting the medication *into* your dog: [PAUSE] Don't hide it in a treat and hope for the best.

[B-ROLL CUE: Dog spitting out pill hidden in cheese]

Dogs are surprisingly good at eating around pills. Instead, use a pill pocket specifically designed for this [ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Pill Pockets available at pet stores"], or ask your vet about liquid formulations if your pet really won't take pills."
```

## Readability Checklist

Before finalizing script, check:
- [ ] Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 8th grade or below (use Hemingway App or similar)
- [ ] Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- [ ] Jargon: Defined immediately or replaced with simple term
- [ ] Pronounceable: Read script out loud - does anything trip you up?
- [ ] Conversational: Does it sound like a human talking, not a textbook?

**Tools:**
- Hemingway App (hemingwayapp.com) - Free readability checker
- Grammarly - Catches overly complex sentences
- Read aloud - Best test is to literally read your script

## Word Count Targets by Video Length

| Video Length | Word Count | Speaking Pace |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 3-4 minutes | 600-800 words | 200 wpm |
| 5-6 minutes | 1,000-1,200 words | 200 wpm |
| 6-7 minutes | 1,200-1,500 words | 200 wpm |
| 8-10 minutes | 1,600-2,000 words | 200 wpm |

**Our target:** 5-7 minutes = 1,200-1,500 words

Shorter videos (3-4 min) can work for simple topics. Longer videos (8-10 min) only if topic demands depth and you can maintain retention.

[See separate file: `/tasks/example-script-medication-labels.md` for full worked example]

---

## Pro Tips

**For viewer retention:**
- Hook in first 10 seconds (before they swipe away)
- Use pattern interrupts (change visuals every 20-30 seconds)
- Tease next point: "But here's what most pet owners don't realize..." (keeps them watching)

**For AI voiceover:**
- Shorter sentences = more natural pacing
- Mark pauses explicitly [PAUSE] so AI doesn't rush
- Avoid complex punctuation (semicolons, em dashes) - AI may not interpret correctly

**For SEO:**
- Use target keyword in first 30 seconds of script (e.g., "pet medication labels")
- Repeat keyword 2-3 times naturally throughout script
- Use related terms (e.g., "prescription," "dosage," "vet instructions")

**For engagement:**
- Ask rhetorical questions: "Have you ever wondered...?"
- Use "you" and "your pet" (personal, not generic "dog owners")
- Acknowledge common frustrations: "I know this is confusing..."
