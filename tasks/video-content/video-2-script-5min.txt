Your vet just handed you blood test results for your dog that look like hieroglyphics. Numbers, abbreviations, red flags everywhere.

...

In the next five minutes, I'll decode what those blood panel results mean, which numbers matter most, and when red flags are actually concerning.

All information is sourced from VCA Animal Hospitals, PetMD, and the American Animal Hospital Association. Let's break it down.

...

Here's what we'll cover: What a CBC measures, understanding red and white blood cells, chemistry panels for organ function, and what "normal range" really means.

Before we start: This is educational content to help you understand your vet's explanations. Always have your vet interpret results.

...

CBC stands for Complete Blood Count. It measures three cell types: red blood cells that carry oxygen, white blood cells that fight infection, and platelets that help blood clot.

Your vet doesn't just look at counts. They examine how cells appear under a microscope. A low count with healthy-looking cells being actively produced is actually a positive sign.

...

Red blood cells are oxygen carriers. Your results show RBC count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and reticulocytes which are young red cells.

Low counts equal anemia. Mild elevations often mean dehydration or excitement. Cell size matters too. Large cells might indicate vitamin deficiency, small cells suggest iron deficiency.

...

White blood cells are your dog's defense. Five types measured: Neutrophils fight bacteria. Lymphocytes fight viruses. Monocytes clean up dead tissue. Eosinophils respond to allergies. Basophils handle allergic reactions.

Normal to high counts mean your dog can fight infection. Extremely high or low suggests severe infection or bone marrow disease. Important: A high white cell count often means the immune system is doing its job.

...

Chemistry panels check organ function. For liver: ALT is a leakage enzyme, elevated when liver cells are injured. ALP indicates bile duct issues. AST comes from liver and muscles.

For kidneys: BUN is waste filtered by kidneys. High levels suggest poor filtering or dehydration. Creatinine is more specific, high levels indicate reduced kidney function.

Glucose measures blood sugar. High might indicate diabetes. Low could signal pancreatic tumor or severe infection.

These tests catch problems early, before symptoms appear.

...

What does "normal range" mean? It's established for average healthy dogs. But breed matters, Greyhounds differ from German Shepherds. Age matters, puppies differ from seniors. Some healthy dogs run slightly high or low their whole lives.

...

When to be concerned: Values significantly outside range. Multiple abnormal values together. Trending worse over time. Or abnormal values matching your dog's symptoms.

When not to panic: Single mildly abnormal value with no symptoms. Values improving on retest after hydration. Known breed-specific variations.

Critical rule: Always interpret with your vet. A flag doesn't automatically mean crisis.

...

Common mistakes: Thinking red flags mean serious illness. They just mean outside normal range, could be dehydration, stress, or breed variation.

Thinking normal numbers mean perfect health. Blood work is one tool, physical exam matters too.

Thinking high white cells mean infection is worsening. Often means strong immune response, which is good.

Trying to interpret results alone by Googling. Your vet interprets all values together with breed, age, and symptoms.

...

Recap: CBC measures red cells, white cells, platelets. Red cells show anemia and oxygen transport. White cells show immune function. Chemistry panels check liver, kidneys, glucose. Normal ranges vary. Flags don't always mean emergency.
