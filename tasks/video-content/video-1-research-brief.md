# Video 1 Research Brief: How to Read Pet Medication Labels

## Key Question
"My vet just prescribed medication for my pet, but the label is confusing. What do all these terms mean and how do I give this safely?"

## Main Points (5 points)

### 1. Understanding Dosage Instructions - The Most Critical Part
**What it means:** "Give 1 tablet by mouth every 12 hours" breaks down to: one tablet (not crushed unless vet approves), directly in pet's mouth (not necessarily in food), exactly 12 hours apart (use phone alarm).

**Common mistake:** Pet owners think "morning and night" equals "every 12 hours" but 7 AM to 11 PM is actually 16 hours apart, not 12. Consistent timing keeps medication at therapeutic levels in the pet's body.

**Key takeaway:** Skip missed doses - never double up. If you miss a dose, skip it and resume the regular schedule.

### 2. Label Components - What's Actually On There
**Required information on prescription labels:**
- Veterinarian's name and contact
- Pet's name (highlight this in multi-pet households to avoid mix-ups)
- Drug name (both active ingredient and brand name)
- Dosage amount and frequency
- Expiration date
- Storage requirements
- Warning: "Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian"

**Why it matters:** Having pharmacy info, drug name, and prescription number readable makes refills easier and administration safer.

### 3. Storage Requirements - More Important Than You Think
**Temperature matters:**
- Room temperature: Store in cool, dry place (pantry, NOT bathroom - humidity fluctuates)
- Refrigerated: 36-46°F, never freeze unless specified
- Never leave in hot cars or direct sunlight

**Impact:** Temperature and humidity can alter medication effectiveness. Improper storage can reduce effectiveness significantly.

**Special cases:** Eye drops expire 28 days after opening and can become contaminated. Compounded medications have shorter expiration (usually 1 month after mixing).

### 4. Expiration Dates - When They Actually Matter
**FDA definition:** Expiration date is when 10% of the active pharmaceutical ingredient has decomposed. After this date, medications may not be safe or effective.

**Practical tip:** Check expiration dates twice yearly when clocks change for daylight saving time. Use this as a reminder to discard expired medications and request refills.

**Why it matters:** Expired medications become less effective, and injectable forms may harbor bacteria.

### 5. Safety Warnings and When to Call the Vet
**Warning labels explained:**
- "For animal use only" - Not for human consumption
- "Keep out of reach of children" - Approx. 60,000 children visit ERs annually from inappropriate medication access
- "Shake well" - Ingredients settle, must mix for proper dosing
- "Do not use if pregnant" - For handlers, some medications can be absorbed through skin

**Call vet if:**
- You miss multiple doses and don't know how to resume
- Side effects occur (vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, behavior changes)
- Label becomes illegible or you're confused about instructions
- Pet refuses medication consistently
- You're considering using leftover medication for a new issue (DON'T - can be harmful and delays diagnosis)

## Important Facts/Statistics
- Approximately 60,000 children visit emergency rooms annually from inappropriate medication access (keep medications secured)
- Eye drops expire 28 days after opening, even if bottle expiration date is months away
- FDA defines expiration as the point when 10% of active ingredient has decomposed
- Many pet medications contain flavoring agents (smell like candy/chocolate) making them attractive to pets and children

## Common Misconceptions to Address

**Misconception 1:** "I can stop the medication when my pet feels better"
**Truth:** Complete the full course unless vet says otherwise. Stopping early (especially antibiotics) can lead to relapse or antibiotic resistance.

**Misconception 2:** "I can split tablets to save money or adjust dosage"
**Truth:** Only if vet specifically approves AND tablet is scored for splitting. Some medications have special coatings that break down in specific parts of digestive system.

**Misconception 3:** "Morning and night" = "Every 12 hours"
**Truth:** You need exact 12-hour spacing (e.g., 8 AM and 8 PM), not just twice daily at convenient times.

**Misconception 4:** "I can use leftover medication if my pet has the same symptoms again"
**Truth:** Never reuse without vet approval. Can be harmful and delays accurate diagnosis.

**Misconception 5:** "Bathroom medicine cabinet is fine for storage"
**Truth:** Bathrooms have humidity fluctuations that can degrade medications. Pantry is better.

## Visual Opportunities (B-roll ideas)
- Close-up shots of medication bottles and prescription labels (show various label components)
- Pet owner's hand holding bottle, reading label with confused expression
- Calendar/clock imagery showing 12-hour spacing (8 AM to 8 PM visual)
- Split screen: refrigerator vs. bathroom cabinet for storage comparison
- Pet owner setting phone alarm for medication reminder
- Pet receiving medication (both pill and liquid forms)
- Storage locations: pantry shelf (good) vs. bathroom (bad) vs. hot car (very bad)
- Expired medication bottles with highlighted dates
- Multi-pet household: multiple prescription bottles with names highlighted
- Pet owner disposing of expired medication properly (coffee grounds method)

## Disclaimer Needs
- "This is educational content, not veterinary advice"
- "Always follow your veterinarian's specific instructions for your pet"
- "Never adjust dosages or stop medication without consulting your vet"
- "If you suspect your pet ingested medication incorrectly, contact your vet immediately"
- "Dosages and medications vary by pet - what works for one pet may harm another"

## Quality Checks
- [x] Do I have at least 3 authoritative sources? YES (VCA, FDA, PetMD)
- [x] Can I explain each main point in simple terms? YES (8th grade reading level achieved)
- [x] Is anything potentially dangerous if misunderstood? YES - added heavy disclaimers about never adjusting dosages, completing full courses, calling vet with questions
- [x] Would a vet watching this cringe or nod in approval? Should NOD - all information is accurate, properly sourced, and heavily disclaimed

## Script Writing Notes

**Tone to use:**
- Empathetic ("This can be confusing - you're not alone")
- Practical ("Here's exactly what to do")
- Safety-focused without being fear-mongering
- Conversational, not clinical

**Structure for script:**
1. Hook: Relatable scenario (just got prescription, label looks like another language)
2. Promise: "I'll decode every part of that label"
3. 5 main points (each 1-1.5 minutes)
4. Common mistakes section (45 seconds)
5. Recap + CTA

**Target length:** 6-7 minutes (1,200-1,400 words)
