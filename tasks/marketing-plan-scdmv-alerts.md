# Marketing Plan: SC DMV Alerts

**Generated:** January 23, 2026
**Goal:** $500 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
**90-Day Target:** 1,000+ free users, 50-80 paid subscribers
**Budget:** $0 (organic only)
**Time Investment:** 5+ hours/week

## Executive Summary

Win through hyperlocal community presence and SEO dominance. The NC competitor proved the model works and got traction through local news coverage. We'll replicate that playbook: become the helpful "SC DMV expert" in every South Carolina community online, then convert that trust into paid subscribers when people hit the frustration point of not finding appointments.

## Market Analysis

### Target Audience Segments

| Segment | Description | Pain Point | Where They Hang Out |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Primary** | Teens (16-17) + Parents | 180-day permit hold ending, need road test ASAP for school/work | r/southcarolina, Facebook parent groups, high school communities |
| **Secondary** | New SC residents (18-30) | Need to transfer license, CDL for new job | Reddit city subs, Nextdoor, apartment community groups |
| **Tertiary** | CDL seekers | Career change, trucking jobs require CDL fast | Trucking forums, indeed/job site communities, CDL school students |

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Their Marketing |
|------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| [ncdmvappointments.com](https://www.ncdmvappointments.com) | 2,000+ users, news coverage, established | NC only, $19.99/mo (expensive), no free tier | Local news PR, SEO content, city-specific landing pages |
| [driving-tests.org](https://driving-tests.org/south-carolina/) | Strong SEO, practice tests | No alert service, just content | Pure SEO play |
| Official DMV site | Free, official | Clunky, no alerts, appointments book fast | None (government) |

### Market Positioning

**Your unique angle:** "Free DMV appointment alerts for South Carolina - because the official site doesn't notify you when spots open up."

**Why now:** SC DMV website just changed (Jan 2026), people are confused. Appointments still book out weeks. Frustration is high.

**Moat:** First mover in SC + local SEO content + free tier builds audience before competitors notice.

- **No LinkedIn** - Wrong demographic for DMV appointments
- **No over-engineering the funnel** - Free → paid upgrade is simple, don't add complexity
- **No multi-state expansion yet** - Dominate SC first, then consider NC/GA

## Content Templates

### Reddit Launch Post (r/southcarolina)

```
Title: I built a free tool to help South Carolinians get DMV road test appointments faster

Hey r/southcarolina,

Like a lot of you, I got frustrated trying to book a DMV appointment. The official site shows everything booked out for weeks, and the only option is to keep refreshing and hope for a cancellation.

So I built scdmvappointments.com - it monitors all 65 SC DMV locations every few minutes and sends you a free email alert the moment an appointment opens up.

It covers:
- Road tests (Class D)
- Motorcycle tests
- CDL (Class A, B, C)
- All 8 regions across the state

The free tier gets you 1 alert per day. There's a paid option if you want more alerts + SMS, but honestly the free version works for most people.

I'm not affiliated with the DMV at all - just a developer who got tired of refreshing.

Would love feedback if you try it. And if you've got tips for getting appointments faster, drop them below - I'm always updating the guides section.

### TikTok Caption Template

```
POV: You've been refreshing the SC DMV website for 2 weeks 😭

I built a free tool that does the refreshing for you and texts you when appointments open up.
