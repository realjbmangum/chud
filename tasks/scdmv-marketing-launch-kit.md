I built a free tool to help South Carolinians get DMV appointments faster.

scdmvappointments.com monitors all 65 SC DMV locations 24/7 and sends you an alert the instant a road test slot opens up.

Stop refreshing. Start driving. 🚗

It's free. Thread below 🧵👇
```

### Thread (Post as Replies)

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem:

SC DMV road test appointments book out 3-4 weeks.

Your only option? Refresh the website constantly hoping someone cancels.

Waste of time. Frustrating. Easy to miss openings.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The solution:

I built a system that checks for new appointments every 5 minutes - even at 3am when cancellations often drop.

When a slot opens, you get an instant email (or text with Pro).
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
What's covered:

🚗 Road tests (Class D)
🏍️ Motorcycle tests
🚛 CDL (Class A, B, C)

All 65 SC DMV locations across 8 regions:
Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Spartanburg, Florence, Rock Hill, Aiken
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
The free tier gets you 1 alert per day.

Pro ($5.99/mo) = 3 alerts + SMS
CDL Pro ($19.99/mo) = 5 alerts + SMS + CDL types

Most people just need the free version.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
I'm not affiliated with the DMV - just a developer who got tired of the refresh game.

Check it out: scdmvappointments.com

And if you have feedback or ideas, reply here. Always improving it. 🙏

### Posting Instructions
1. Post the first tweet
2. Reply to it with Tweet 2, then reply to that with Tweet 3, etc.
3. Pin the first tweet to your profile
4. After posting, engage with any replies

### r/southcarolina Post (Copy/Paste)

**Title:**
```
I built a free tool to help South Carolinians get DMV road test appointments faster
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/southcarolina,

Like a lot of you, I got frustrated trying to book a DMV appointment. The official site shows everything booked out for weeks, and the only option is to keep refreshing and hope for a cancellation.

So I built **scdmvappointments.com** - it monitors all 65 SC DMV locations every few minutes and sends you a free email alert the moment an appointment opens up.

**What it covers:**
- Road tests (Class D)
- Motorcycle tests
- CDL (Class A, B, C)
- All 8 regions: Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Spartanburg, Florence, Rock Hill, Aiken

**How it works:**
1. Sign up with your email
2. Pick your region and test type
3. Get an alert when a slot opens
4. Book it on the official DMV site before anyone else

The free tier gets you 1 alert per day - that's enough for most people. There's a paid option for more alerts + SMS if you're in a hurry.

I'm not affiliated with the DMV at all - just a developer who got tired of the refresh game.

**Link:** https://scdmvappointments.com

Would love feedback if you try it. And if you've got tips for getting appointments faster, drop them below - I'm always updating the guides section on the site.
```

### Posting Instructions
1. Go to r/southcarolina
2. Click "Create Post" → Text post
3. Paste title and body
4. Submit
5. **IMPORTANT:** Stay online for 2-3 hours after posting to reply to every comment
6. Be genuine, thank people, answer questions

### Sample Reply Templates

**If someone says "This is great!":**
```
Thanks! Hope it helps you get an appointment faster. Let me know if you have any issues with it.
```

**If someone asks "Is this legit?":**
```
Totally understand the skepticism! It's a side project I built - not affiliated with the DMV at all. The free tier is actually free (no credit card required). I only make money if someone upgrades to Pro for more alerts.
```

**If someone reports a bug:**
```
Oh no, sorry about that! Can you DM me the details? I'll fix it ASAP. Thanks for letting me know.
```

**If a mod asks about self-promotion:**
```
Happy to take this down if it's against the rules - just wanted to share something I thought might help folks here. Let me know!
```

### Press Release (Save as PDF)

```
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOCAL DEVELOPER CREATES FREE TOOL TO HELP SOUTH CAROLINIANS GET DMV APPOINTMENTS FASTER

[Your City], SC - January 2026

South Carolina residents frustrated with weeks-long waits for DMV road test appointments now have a free solution. SCDMVAppointments.com, created by local developer [Your Name], monitors all 65 SC DMV locations around the clock and sends instant alerts when appointment slots become available.

"The official DMV website doesn't notify you when appointments open up," said [Your Name]. "You're stuck refreshing the page hoping someone cancels. I built this tool so people can sign up once and get notified automatically."

The service covers road tests, motorcycle tests, and commercial driver's license (CDL) appointments across all eight SC DMV regions including Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, and Myrtle Beach.

The basic service is free, with a premium tier available for users who want SMS alerts and more frequent notifications.

Key Features:
• Monitors all 65 SC DMV locations every 5 minutes
• Instant email alerts when appointments open
• Covers road tests, motorcycle, and CDL
• Free tier available with no credit card required

### Email Pitch Template (Copy/Paste)

**Subject:** Local Developer Creates Free Tool to Help SC Residents Get DMV Appointments Faster

```
Hi [Name],

South Carolina DMV appointments often book out 3-4 weeks, leaving residents stuck refreshing the website hoping for cancellations.

I built scdmvappointments.com - a free service that monitors all 65 SC DMV locations 24/7 and sends instant alerts when appointments open up.

A similar service in North Carolina was recently featured on WCNC and has helped over 2,000 residents book appointments faster. I wanted to offer the same solution for South Carolina.

Would you be interested in a quick story? I'm happy to provide:
- Screenshots and a demo of how it works
- Data on appointment availability across SC
- A brief interview about why I built it

The service is free and I'm not affiliated with the DMV - just a developer who got frustrated with the system.

Thank you for your time!
