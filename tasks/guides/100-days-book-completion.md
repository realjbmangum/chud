## Daily Workflow

1. **Start:** `100days dashboard` - see where you are
2. **Work:** Focus on ONE chapter per session
3. **Review:** Run editor-agent on completed work
4. **Revise:** Address priority feedback
5. **Track:** Update this checklist

---

## Editor Agent Usage

After completing any chapter draft or revision:

```
"Edit chapter [X]" or "Run editor review on chapter [X]"
```

The editor will check:
- Voice consistency (brian_voice_guide.md)
- Forbidden elements (litotes, em dashes, anaphora)
- Story vs sermon balance
- Sensory grounding
- Pacing and transitions
- Publisher-readiness

---

- [ ] Opens with impact
- [ ] No forbidden elements
- [ ] Every emotion anchored physically

## Notes

- Don't aim for perfection on first pass - get words down, then revise
- Interview before writing helps surface the real stories
- Editor-agent catches voice drift early - use it often
- The chapters 6-8 are strongest - use them as reference
- Chapter 2 needs the most work - don't skip the hard one
