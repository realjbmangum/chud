# HeyGen + ElevenLabs Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide covers:
- **Story 2:** Creating your AI presenter avatar in HeyGen
- **Story 3:** Selecting and configuring your voice in ElevenLabs

**Total time:** 2-4 hours (mostly testing different options)

---

# Part 1: HeyGen AI Presenter Setup

## Step 1: Sign Up for HeyGen

1. Go to https://www.heygen.com/
2. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. Create account with email or Google sign-in

## Step 2: Choose Your Plan

**Recommended: Creator Plan**
- **Annual:** $24/month (best value)
- **Monthly:** $29/month
- **What you get:** Unlimited videos up to 30 minutes each, perfect for 3-4 videos/week at 5-7 min each

**Why not free plan?**
- Free plan: Only 3 videos/month (not enough for 3-4/week schedule)
- You need consistent output to hit monetization

**Action:** Subscribe to Creator Plan (annual if you're committing, monthly if testing)

---

## Step 3: Explore Avatar Options

HeyGen offers two types of avatars:

### Option A: Stock Avatars (Easiest)

**Pros:**
- Ready to use immediately
- Professional quality
- No extra work

**Cons:**
- Other creators may use same avatar
- Less unique to your brand

**How to use:**
1. In HeyGen dashboard, go to "Avatars"
2. Browse stock avatars
3. Filter by: age, gender, ethnicity, professional style
4. Preview each by typing test script

**What to look for:**
- **Age:** 30s-50s tends to convey more authority for medical topics
- **Appearance:** Professional but approachable, not overly formal
- **Expression:** Warm, trustworthy, not stern
- **Clothing:** Casual professional (not suit, not t-shirt)

### Option B: Custom Avatar (More Unique)

**Pros:**
- Unique to your channel
- Can match your exact brand vision
- More authentic-looking if done well

**Cons:**
- Requires photo reference(s)
- Takes iteration to get right (Reddit poster tested 15 combinations)
- May look uncanny if photo quality is poor

**How to create:**
1. In HeyGen dashboard, go to "Create Avatar"
2. Upload reference photo(s):
   - High resolution (min 1080p)
   - Well-lit, neutral background
   - Face clearly visible, neutral expression
   - Multiple angles if possible
3. HeyGen processes (takes 1-2 hours)
4. Test resulting avatar with script

**Important:** Custom avatars may require paid add-on depending on plan. Check current pricing.

**My recommendation for first video:** Use stock avatar to move fast. You can always change avatars later if needed.

---

## Step 4: Avatar Selection Criteria

Test 5-10 avatars with this 30-second sample script:

```
"If your vet just prescribed medication for your pet, the label might look confusing. In this video, I'll explain exactly what each part means, from dosage instructions to storage requirements. All information is sourced from veterinary schools and the AVMA. Let's break it down."
```

**Evaluation checklist for each avatar:**

### Visual Quality:
- [ ] Lip sync is accurate (words match mouth movements)
- [ ] Eye movements look natural (not dead stare)
- [ ] Facial expressions are appropriate for content tone
- [ ] No uncanny valley effect (doesn't look "off" or creepy)
- [ ] Lighting looks natural

### Brand Fit:
- [ ] Conveys trustworthiness for medical information
- [ ] Appears knowledgeable but not condescending
- [ ] Age/appearance matches target audience expectations
- [ ] Clothing is appropriate (professional casual)

### Technical Quality:
- [ ] Video quality is HD (1080p minimum)
- [ ] No glitches or artifacts in rendering
- [ ] Background is clean and non-distracting

**Reddit poster's insight:** "Took maybe 15 different reference photo combinations before I got something that looked natural."

Don't settle on first avatar you try. Test multiple.

---

## Step 5: Voice Options in HeyGen

HeyGen has built-in text-to-speech voices. You have two options:

### Option A: Use HeyGen's Built-in Voices (Simpler)

**Pros:**
- Integrated workflow (script → video in one place)
- Automatically synced to avatar
- One less tool to manage

**Cons:**
- May be less customizable than ElevenLabs
- You're not using your existing ElevenLabs subscription

**How to use:**
1. In video editor, paste your script
2. Select voice from HeyGen's library
3. Preview to test lip sync and voice quality

### Option B: Import Custom Audio from ElevenLabs (Better Quality)

**Pros:**
- ElevenLabs voices may sound more natural
- You're leveraging existing subscription
- More control over voice characteristics

**Cons:**
- Two-step workflow (generate audio, then import)
- Need to verify HeyGen supports custom audio import

**How to use:**
1. Generate voiceover in ElevenLabs (see Part 2 below)
2. Download as MP3 or WAV
3. In HeyGen, check if you can upload custom audio
   - Look for "Import Audio" or similar option
   - If not available, use HeyGen's built-in voices

**Action:** Test HeyGen's built-in voices first. If quality is insufficient, investigate custom audio import option.

---

## Step 6: Create Test Video

**Goal:** Make a 30-60 second test video to verify everything works.

**Steps:**
1. Select your chosen avatar
2. Paste test script (same one from Step 4)
3. Select voice (HeyGen built-in or imported ElevenLabs)
4. Click "Generate" or "Create Video"
5. Wait for processing (usually 2-5 minutes)
6. Download and review

**Quality checks:**
- Watch on phone (most viewers watch on mobile)
- Show to a friend: "Does this look/sound natural?"
- Check at 0.5x speed for lip sync accuracy
- Listen without watching: Is voice clear and pleasant?

---

## Step 7: Save Your Settings

Once you're happy with avatar and voice:
- [ ] Screenshot your settings (avatar name, voice settings)
- [ ] Save test video file as reference
- [ ] Document exactly which avatar/voice you used
- [ ] Consider making 2-3 variations for different video types (if needed)

**Consistency matters:** Use the same avatar and voice for all videos (at least for first 3 months). Changing frequently confuses viewers.

---

# Part 2: ElevenLabs Voice Setup

## Step 1: Access Your ElevenLabs Account

1. Go to https://elevenlabs.io/
2. Sign in (you mentioned you already have a subscription)
3. Navigate to "Voices" or "Voice Library"

---

## Step 2: Test Voices with Sample Script

Use the same 30-second script from HeyGen testing for consistency:

```
"If your vet just prescribed medication for your pet, the label might look confusing. In this video, I'll explain exactly what each part means, from dosage instructions to storage requirements. All information is sourced from veterinary schools and the AVMA. Let's break it down."
```

**Test 10-15 different voices across these categories:**

### Category 1: Professional & Trustworthy
- Aim for: Clear enunciation, moderate pacing, warm but authoritative
- Age sound: 30s-40s
- Think: NPR podcast host, documentary narrator

### Category 2: Friendly & Approachable
- Aim for: Conversational, slightly upbeat, not overly energetic
- Age sound: Late 20s-30s
- Think: Helpful friend explaining something

### Category 3: Expert & Calm
- Aim for: Measured, reassuring, knowledgeable
- Age sound: 40s-50s
- Think: College professor, experienced professional

**Action:** Generate the test script with 10-15 different voices. Listen to each.

---

## Step 3: Voice Selection Criteria

**Listening checklist for each voice:**

### Clarity & Intelligibility:
- [ ] Every word is clearly pronounced
- [ ] No slurring or mumbling
- [ ] Appropriate for international audience (clear accent)
- [ ] Technical terms sound natural (test with vet jargon)

### Tone & Personality:
- [ ] Warm and trustworthy (not robotic)
- [ ] Authority without being condescending
- [ ] Calm and reassuring (this is health information)
- [ ] Not overly enthusiastic (not a hype video)

### Technical Quality:
- [ ] No artifacts, glitches, or distortion
- [ ] Consistent volume throughout
- [ ] Natural breathing sounds (if present)
- [ ] Pacing is appropriate (not too fast or slow)

### Audience Fit:
- [ ] Matches the authority of topic (vet education)
- [ ] Gender matches avatar (if using HeyGen custom audio import)
- [ ] Won't become grating over 5-7 minutes
- [ ] Sounds human, not obviously AI

---

## Step 4: Long-Form Test

Once you've narrowed to 2-3 favorite voices, test with a longer script (1-2 minutes):

**Longer test script:**

```
"Understanding your pet's medication label can feel like reading a foreign language. But it doesn't have to be that complicated. Today, I'm going to walk you through every section of a standard pet medication label, so you know exactly what you're giving your pet, when to give it, and what to watch for.

First, let's talk about dosage instructions. You'll typically see something like 'Give one tablet by mouth every twelve hours.' This means one tablet - not crushed or split unless your vet specifically says so - goes directly in your pet's mouth. And every twelve hours means exactly that. If you give the first dose at 8 AM, the next dose should be at 8 PM, not whenever you get home from work.

Here's a common mistake: pet owners think 'morning and night' means the same as 'every twelve hours,' but if morning is 7 AM and night is 11 PM, that's actually sixteen hours apart. Use a phone alarm to keep it consistent. Your pet's body processes medication at a steady rate, and maintaining consistent timing ensures the medication stays at therapeutic levels."
```

**Why longer test?**
- Some voices sound great for 30 seconds but become grating over time
- Longer scripts reveal pacing issues
- Tests how voice handles educational explanations vs. short hooks

---

## Step 5: Advanced Voice Customization (Optional)

If ElevenLabs offers voice customization (many plans do):

**Adjustable parameters:**
- **Stability:** Lower = more expressive, Higher = more consistent
  - For educational content: Medium-high stability (60-80%)
- **Clarity:** How clearly enunciated words are
  - For educational content: High clarity (80-90%)
- **Similarity:** How closely AI matches reference voice (if using voice cloning)
  - Start at default, adjust if needed

**Action:** If your plan allows, experiment with these settings on your chosen voice.

---

## Step 6: Save Voice Settings

Once you've selected your voice:
- [ ] Note the exact voice name in ElevenLabs
- [ ] Screenshot your settings (stability, clarity, etc.)
- [ ] Save a sample audio file as reference
- [ ] Document this in a "Production Settings" doc

**For every future video:**
- Use the same voice
- Use the same settings
- Maintain consistency

---

## Step 7: Integration Decision

**Now decide on your workflow:**

### Workflow A: HeyGen Voice Only (Simpler)
1. Write script
2. Paste into HeyGen
3. Select HeyGen built-in voice
4. Generate video
5. Download

**Pros:** One tool, faster workflow
**Cons:** Not using your ElevenLabs subscription

### Workflow B: ElevenLabs + HeyGen (Better Quality, if supported)
1. Write script
2. Generate voiceover in ElevenLabs
3. Download audio file
4. Import audio into HeyGen with avatar
5. Generate video with custom audio
6. Download

**Pros:** Better voice quality, uses your existing subscription
**Cons:** Two-step process, need to verify HeyGen supports custom audio

**Action:** Test both workflows with your 30-second sample. Choose based on:
- Which sounds better?
- Which is faster?
- Does quality difference justify extra step?

---

## Part 3: First Video Production Test

**Goal:** Create a complete 1-minute test video using your chosen avatar and voice.

### Test Script (1 minute, ~200 words):

```
If your vet just prescribed medication for your pet, the label might look confusing. In this video, I'll explain exactly what each part means.

First, dosage instructions. You'll typically see something like 'Give one tablet by mouth every twelve hours.' This means one tablet goes directly in your pet's mouth, and you'll give it exactly twelve hours apart. Use a phone alarm to stay consistent.

Next, check the active ingredient versus the brand name. The label shows both because the active ingredient is what actually treats your pet, while the brand name is just who makes it. If you ever need a refill, knowing the active ingredient helps your vet find alternatives if needed.

Finally, storage requirements matter more than you think. Some medications need refrigeration, others need to stay dry. Follow these exactly, because improper storage can reduce effectiveness by up to fifty percent.

This is educational content, not veterinary advice. Always follow your vet's specific instructions. If this video helped, give it a thumbs up and drop a comment with your questions.
```

---

## Part 5: Iteration & Refinement

**If test video isn't quite right:**

### Avatar issues:
- Try different avatar from HeyGen library
- Adjust camera angle/framing if option available
- Test different clothing style (formal vs. casual)

### Voice issues:
- Try different voice from library
- Adjust stability/clarity settings
- Test different gender/age

### Lip sync issues:
- Check audio quality (clearer audio = better lip sync)
- Try shorter sentences in script
- Ensure proper punctuation (helps AI with pacing)

**Iterate until you're satisfied.** Reddit poster tested 15 avatar variations. Don't settle too quickly.

## Pro Tips

**For HeyGen:**
- Shorter sentences = better lip sync
- Use proper punctuation (helps AI with pacing)
- Avoid complex words that might be mispronounced
- Preview before final render (saves credits)

**For ElevenLabs:**
- Use [PAUSE] tags in script for natural breaks
- Mark pronunciation for vet terms: "dysplasia [dis-PLAY-zhuh]"
- Higher clarity = more robotic, find balance
- Test on multiple devices (phone, laptop, headphones)

**For both:**
- Consistency is key - same avatar and voice for all videos
- Save your test videos as references
- Document everything (you'll forget settings)
- Don't overthink it - perfect is the enemy of done

**Remember:** Reddit poster mentioned videos took time to "look natural." Your first few videos might feel off. That's normal. You'll refine as you go.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Avatar looks uncanny/off:**
- Try different avatar
- Check lighting in reference photo (if custom)
- Ensure high-quality source image

**Lip sync is bad:**
- Simplify script (shorter sentences)
- Check audio quality
- Try different avatar (some sync better)

**Voice sounds robotic:**
- Lower stability setting in ElevenLabs
- Try different voice
- Add more natural language in script (contractions, casual phrasing)

**Video takes too long to render:**
- HeyGen typically takes 2-5 min for 5-7 min video
- If longer, contact support or check system status

**Can't import custom audio to HeyGen:**
- Check your plan level (may be Creator+ feature)
- Use HeyGen built-in voices instead
- Contact HeyGen support to verify
