        Why go indie?

          Independent pharmacies put your health first. No corporate boardroom making decisions about your prescriptions.
          Here's why more Americans are making the switch.
        </p>

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-stone-900 mb-4">The problem: your pharmacy and your insurance are the same company</h2>

          <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
            In 2018, CVS Health acquired Aetna insurance for $69 billion. Now the same company
            that fills your prescriptions also decides what your insurance covers. Think about that.
          </p>

          <ul class="space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>Steering patients:</strong> Insurance formularies can push patients toward CVS pharmacies,
              regardless of whether they offer the best service or price.
            </li>
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>Higher costs:</strong> When your insurance company owns the pharmacy, they have incentives
              to maximize revenue, not minimize your out-of-pocket costs.
            </li>
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>Reduced choice:</strong> Independent pharmacies are often excluded from "preferred networks"
              or face reimbursement rates that force them to close.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-4 mb-6 rounded-r-lg">
            <p class="text-red-800">
              <strong>Fact:</strong> CVS Health owns 9,900+ pharmacies and the Aetna insurance plan,
              which covers 22+ million Americans. That's a conflict of interest, plain and simple.

        <section class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-stone-900 mb-4">What you get with an indie pharmacy</h2>

          <div class="space-y-8">
            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-900 mb-2">1. A pharmacist who knows you</h3>
              <p class="text-stone-700">
                At an independent pharmacy, you're not a prescription number. Your pharmacist knows your name,
                your medications, your allergies. That personal relationship catches drug interactions
                and saves lives. Try getting that at a drive-through window.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-900 mb-2">2. Zero corporate conflicts</h3>
              <p class="text-stone-700">
                Independent pharmacies don't own insurance companies or pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).
                Their only motivation is taking care of you. Not quarterly earnings. Not shareholder returns.
                You.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-900 mb-2">3. Your money stays local</h3>
              <p class="text-stone-700">
                When you fill a prescription at an indie pharmacy, those dollars circulate in your community.
                Local jobs. Little League sponsorships. The pharmacist whose kid goes to school with yours.
                That's real economic impact.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-900 mb-2">4. Services chains can't match</h3>
              <p class="text-stone-700">
                Compounding, home delivery, pet meds, medication synchronization, blister packing for elderly patients.
                Independent pharmacies specialize because they can. Chains standardize because they have to.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-900 mb-2">5. Competitive pricing (seriously)</h3>
              <p class="text-stone-700">
                Contrary to what big pharma wants you to think, independents often match or beat chain prices.
                Many offer discount programs, price matching, and will work with you to find affordable alternatives.
                They want to keep your business.

          <ol class="space-y-4 list-decimal list-inside">
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>Who owns this pharmacy?</strong> Is it independently owned, or part of a chain owned by an insurance company?
            </li>
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>Do you accept my insurance?</strong> Most independent pharmacies accept all major insurance plans.
            </li>
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>Can you price match?</strong> Many independents will match chain prices or offer discount programs.
            </li>
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>What specialized services do you offer?</strong> Ask about compounding, delivery, immunizations, etc.
            </li>
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>Will I see the same pharmacist each time?</strong> Continuity of care matters for medication safety.

          <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">
            This isn't hypothetical. Independent pharmacies are closing at an alarming rate:
          </p>

          <ul class="space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>21,683 independent pharmacies</strong> remain in the US (as of 2023), down from 24,000+ in 2010.
            </li>
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>34% market share</strong> and declining, as chains consolidate and PBMs squeeze reimbursements.
            </li>
            <li class="text-stone-700">
              <strong>Rural communities hit hardest:</strong> Many small towns have lost their only pharmacy.

              <strong>You can change this.</strong> Every prescription you fill at an independent pharmacy
