# SaaS Monetization — Implementation Checklist

## Phase 0: Foundation
- [ ] Sign up for GHL Agency plan ($497/mo)
- [ ] Set up white-label domain (e.g., app.pottypro.com)
- [ ] Learn GHL snapshot system (create + clone templates)
- [ ] Register pottypro.com domain (if not owned)

## Phase 1: Build PottyPro (First Test Case)
- [ ] Build PottyPro snapshot in GHL:
  - [ ] Pipeline: Quote Request → Quoted → Booked → Delivered → Picked Up
  - [ ] 5 automated emails (quote follow-up, booking confirm, delivery reminder, review request, invoice)
  - [ ] Quote request form
  - [ ] Review request automation
  - [ ] Basic reporting dashboard
  - [ ] Template website for porta potty businesses
- [ ] Create landing page: pottydirectory.com/pro
- [ ] Set pricing: $147/mo (or $97/mo launch special)
- [ ] Email 50 verified vendors from DB as beta test
- [ ] **Goal: 5 paying customers = proof of concept**

## Phase 2: Validate + Iterate
- [ ] Get feedback from first 5 customers
- [ ] Refine PottyPro template based on actual usage
- [ ] Document what worked in sales pitch
- [ ] Calculate unit economics: GHL cost vs revenue per customer
- [ ] Refine /pro landing page based on conversion data

## Phase 3: Replicate to RecordStops + Pharmacy
- [ ] Build RecordStops Pro snapshot
- [ ] Build PharmacyHub snapshot
- [ ] Create /pro landing pages on each directory
- [ ] Add "Upgrade to Pro" CTAs on directory listing pages
- [ ] Email outreach to verified businesses in each directory

## Phase 4: Scale to All 20 Directories
- [ ] For each new directory, also build a SaaS snapshot
- [ ] Templatize common parts (review management, CRM, email)
- [ ] Customize only niche-specific pipeline + automations
- [ ] Each new directory launches with all layers from day one
