## Outdoor Network Monetization (campingnative + bestwaterfalls + bestusnationalparks)

> [!warning] Brian needs to provide account IDs before Claude can implement
> **Plan:** [[context/outdoor-network-monetization-plan|Full Implementation Plan]]

**Brian's action items (do these first):**
- [ ] Create 3 GA4 properties (one per site) — get measurement IDs (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
- [ ] Add all 3 sites to Google Search Console — get verification codes
- [ ] Get AdSense publisher ID (`ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX`) — one shared across all sites
- [ ] Confirm Amazon Associates tag to use (e.g. `jbmangum27-20`)
- [ ] After verification: submit sitemaps in Search Console for all 3 sites

**Then Claude implements in this order:**
1. GA4 + Search Console tags (all 3 sites)
2. Cross-promotion footer links (free traffic, all 3 sites)
3. Affiliate links on National Parks gear page (36 products, biggest quick win)
4. AdSense ad placements (all 3 sites)
5. Affiliate links on Camping Native gear posts (80 posts)
6. Affiliate links in Waterfalls guides (lower priority)
